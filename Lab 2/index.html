<h1>Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
<h2>Lola Okinsolu Fried Rice Recipe</h2>
<ul>
      <li>turky or chicken stock</li>
      <li>beef livre</li>
      <li>sweet corn</li>
      <li>green beans</li>
      <li>carrot</li>
      <li>sweet peas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
      <li>It’s ok to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat!</li>
      <li>Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, otherwise, you will end up with soggy fried rice.</li>
      <li>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</li>
      <li>I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn, and Green Beans. However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers can also be used.</li>
      <li>In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn up the heat to high during the frying process and stir continuously as you allow the rice to heat up.</li>
      <li>I added pieces of beef liver to my fried Rice, a lot of people like this as well, but if you don’t want it you are free to leave it out, you will still enjoy the total goodness of the Fried Rice.</li>
      <li>When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or Turkey stock because of their mild taste. The beef stock should be avoided as it can overpower the taste of the fried rice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is my favorite recipe because it comes close to how my mom cooks hers, and her way of cooking the fried rise is the best.</p>
