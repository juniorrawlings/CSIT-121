<h1>XML AND JavaScript</h1>
  <p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) was developed by the W3C to create common information formats and share the format and the information on the Web. It is a text-based syntax designed to describe, deliver, and exchange structured information, such as RSS feeds. XML is not intended to replace HTML, but to extend the power of HTML by separating data from presentation. Using XML, developers can create any tags they need to describe their information.</p>
  <p2> XML is used to transfer data between two systems that store the same data in different formats. For example, your website stores dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, but your accounting system stores dates in DD/MM/YYYY format. You can transfer the data from the website to the accounting system by using XML.</p2> 
  <p3>A XML looks like the picture below</p3>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
   <p4>JavaScript is  an object-based, client-side scripting language interpreted by a web browser. JavaScript is considered to be object-based because itâ€™s used to work with the objects associated with a web page document: the browser window, the document itself, and elements such as forms, images, and links. Because JavaScript is interpreted by a browser, it is considered to be a client-side scripting language. </p4>
  <p5> HTML creates and structures the website's content, CSS adds style and formatting to these structures, and then JavaScript turns those stylized components into something that a user can interact with.</p5> 
  <p6>A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition</p6>
<ul>
   <li>example:person.name = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};.</li>
</ul>      
  
  <p7>Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:</p7>
<ul>
   <li>id</li>
</ul>  
  
   <p8>A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</p8>
<ul>
   <li>person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";</li>
</ul>

   <p9>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</p9>
<ul>
   <li>// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}</li>
</ul>
